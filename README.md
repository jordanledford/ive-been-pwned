#I've been Pwned!!!

##current

A simple website to query the excellent haveibeenpwned.com API, and return whether or not an email has been released publicly on the internet.

##future

I will probably add support to send emails to users if they are ever 'hacked', and I'm also considering adding an option with a minimal fee to send a text via trello the second it happens. Hopefully it never will though. :)
